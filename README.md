# Guitar-Notes-Practice
A Python code to assist learning notes corresponding to each fret for a string.
This program can be used to learn notes position easily. Note name is shown alongwith its corresponding voice and you are given few seconds before the next note. Your task is to play the current note before next note is displayed. 
Example Usage- Memorizing all the notes position one by one per string. 

Requirements:
Python 2.7
Windows(I have not tested on any other OS).

You can change the voice by replacing them with any other voice and saving by the same name as earlier.
If you plan to change the voice run "check all.py" once to ensure everything is working correctly.
